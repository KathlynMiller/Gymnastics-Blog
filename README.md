# [Gymnastics Blog](file:///C:/Users/Student/Gymnastics%20Blog/index.html#page-top) - Rio Olympics


## Getting Started

* My main goal in this project has never changed but I have made changes to make it look better.
* Before started, I didn’t know what to do 
* What inspired me was doing a blog similar how I did my sophomore year 
* And I like making website because they are pretty easy to do.
* I liked this project because it was mainly about what I liked and wanted to do.
* So I decided to do a Gymnastics Blog because I love gymnastics and I did it in the past for about 10 years.

## Unique

* My website is unique by giving you an insight on what the Olympic Gymnasts at Rio 2016 are like and what they do outside of gymnastics.

## Methods 

# I started out with using…

* HTML
* Bootstrap/Agency
* JS
* CSS
* PHP
* CodePen

## Bugs/Issues/Challenges

* My challenges were to put some JS features in my website but I was able to do it without making any errors.
* It was also hard to decide what gifs to put in my project to make it look more interesting.
* I wanted to do a carousel but it didn’t look clean enough so I decided to take it out.



## Future Work

* My last work on this project was to connect it to the server so that it can send messages/comments which would have been cool.
* But other than that, I am satisfied on how my project looks and I am very proud of myself of what I made because I never thought I could achieve something like this.
* Any Questions? Contact me @kathlym.miller@gmail.com
